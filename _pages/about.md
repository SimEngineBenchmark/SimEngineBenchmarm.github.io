### Brief Biography ###
I received my BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering and a PhD in Fault Diagnosis and Control System from Monash University in 2006 and 2009, respectively. I am now a Lecturer at the School of Engineering, Ulster University, UK, and I am attached to the Nanotechnology and Integrated BioEngineering Centre (NIBEC).

My research interests include fault diagnosis, vehicular systems, modelling, signal processing and data analysis for anomaly detection and classification, as well as machine learning.

In 2014–2015, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Division of Vehicular Systems, Linköping University, Sweden, where I worked with Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) in Gothenburg on advanced fault diagnosis schemes in vehicular engines using model-based and data-driven methods.

I was instrumental in developing a Simulation Environment on the Matlab/Simulink platform for realistic Model-In-The-Loop testing of various residuals generation and fault diagnosis methods to be used by VCC for the following:
* Realistic modelling and control of the engine
* Injection and simulation of a variety of actuator, sensor and variable faults in the engine
* In-house designed algorithm for additional residuals selection
* In-house designed algorithm for alarm generations, residuals monitoring as well as Fault Isolation (FI)
* Simulation and FI of system with intermittent residuals

I am also an Adjunct Senior Research Fellow with Monash University Malaysia where I served as a Lecturer from 2009, and subsequently a Senior Lecturer till 2017.
