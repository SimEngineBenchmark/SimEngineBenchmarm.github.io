## Brief Biography ##
I received my BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering and a PhD in Fault Diagnosis and Control System from Monash University in 2006 and 2009, respectively. I am now a Lecturer at the School of Engineering, Ulster University, UK, and I am attached to the Nanotechnology and Integrated BioEngineering Centre (NIBEC).

My research interests include fault diagnosis, vehicular systems, modelling, and data analytics for anomaly detection and classification.

In 2014–2015, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Division of Vehicular Systems, Linköping University, Sweden, where I worked with Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) on advanced fault diagnosis schemes in vehicular engines using model-based and data-driven methods.

I was instrumental in developing a Simulation Environment on the Matlab/Simulink platform for realistic Model-In-The-Loop testing of various residuals generation and fault diagnosis methods for the following:
* Realistic modelling and control of the engine
* Injection and simulation of a variety of actuator, sensor, and variable faults in the engine
* In-house designed algorithm for additional residuals selection
* In-house designed algorithm for alarm generations, residuals monitoring, as well as Fault Isolation (FI)
* Simulation and FI of system with intermittent residuals

I am also a co-investigator in [SAFEWATER](https://www.safewater-research.com), a £5 million project funded by GCRF.

I am also an Adjunct Senior Research Fellow with Monash University Malaysia where I served as a Lecturer from 2009, and subsequently a Senior Lecturer till 2017.

I was responsible as the coordinator of a few units related to Control Engineering for various disciplines offered at the campus. I developed a new unit, ECE3062 Electronic Systems and Control, which is offered at both Monash University Malaysia and Australia campuses. I was an active researcher especially in the area of Fault Diagnosis with quality publications in international peer-reviewed journal articles, including the prestigious Automatica. I also conducted trainings and am involved in a few consulting projects with the industry. I have taught the following units: 
* ECE2061 Analogue Circuits, 2016 – 2017 
* ECE2031 Circuits and Control, 2015
* ECE3062 Electronic Systems & Control (a unit I developed for Monash), 2011 – 2013

**Linköping University and Volvo Car Corporation, Sweden**  
**Visiting Researcher**  
Jan, 2016 – Feb, 2016  
Collaborators: Prof. Erik Frisk, Assoc. Prof. Mattias Krysander, and Dr Daniel Jung

I continued to work on the project described under my position as a Postdoctoral with the same institution. Besides further developing the FI scheme on paper and via simulations, the project also progressed to the testing of the designed FI schemes onto the actual engine in the Engine Lab via the dSPACE control system.

I also developed the GUI-based Simulation Environment on Matlab and Simulink to be used by VCC for the following: 
* Realistic modelling and control of the engine 
* Injection and simulation of a variety of actuator, sensor and variable faults in the engine 
* In-house designed algorithm for additional residuals selection 
* In-house designed algorithms for alarm generations, residuals monitoring as well as Fault Isolation (FI) 
* Simulation and FI of system with intermittent residuals
