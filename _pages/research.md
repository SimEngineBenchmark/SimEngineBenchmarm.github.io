## General Research Activities ##
We primarily conduct research on anomaly detection and classification using model-based and data-driven methods on the following:
* Robotics and mechatronics systems to perform fault diagnosis and to enhance automation and reliability, including Industry 4.0 applications.
* Biomedical signals such as ECG and EEG to identify the key biomarkers for early detection of diseases and to enhance the accuracy of diagnostics.
