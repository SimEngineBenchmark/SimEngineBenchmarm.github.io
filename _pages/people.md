* <p><img align="left" width="120" src="/assets/Figures/Pardis.png" hspace="20"><span>Dr Pardis Biglarbeigi <br />
  Lecturer in Engineering and Data Analytics Scientist <br />
  Bio: Pardis (<a href="mailto:p.biglarbeigi@ulster.ac.uk">p.biglarbeigi@ulster.ac.uk</a>) received the BSc and MSc in Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering from Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Iran and Politecnico di Milano, Italy in 2010 and 2014. Then she moved to UK to pursue the Ph.D. in water resource management and hydroinformatics and graduated in 2019 from Ulster University. Her research interests are numerical modelling in engineering applications, statistical analysis and data processing, signals, wavelet analysis, image processing, machine learning, optimisation, and simulation processes.
During the final six months of her Ph.D., she started working at the Nanotechnology and Integrated BioEngineering Centre (NIBEC) as a part time research  associate, where she researched on signal processing. This changed her research focus from hydroinformatics and water resources modelling to a broader range of engineering modelling and data science.<br />
