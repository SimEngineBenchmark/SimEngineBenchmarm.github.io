## Funded PhD Opportunity ##

Title: Photoelectrocatalytic reactor with microcontroller-based control system for the elimination of antimicrobial resistant organisms in water

Summary: Globally, about 1.8 Billion people live without access to improved water sources. Alarmingly, Contaminants of Emerging Concerns (CECs) such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, metal based nanoparticles, and other pollutants, including pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) were reported to be present in the treated sewage as well as in drinking water around the world. Photoelectrolytic (or electrochemically assisted photocatalytic) treatment of water is an interesting approach for the tertiary treatment of wastewater. This novel technology has been poorly investigated thus far for the simultaneous degradation or organic pollutants and removal of microorganisms present in wastewater. The objective of this PhD project relates to the development of an application of a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) for the removal of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (ARB) in water.

This PhD project will focus on the following main objectives:
 - Detection of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in water using microbial and molecular techniques.
 - Selection and characterisation of an UV sensor material for automatic control of a photoreactor.
 - Design of a microcontroller-based control program for the operation of a photoelectrochemical reactor based on UV dose sensing.
 - Construction and assessment of an photoelectrocatalytic reactor with UV-feedback microcontroller-based control system for the elimination of antimicrobial organisms in water.
