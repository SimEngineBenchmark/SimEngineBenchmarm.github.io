### 1) All existing funded PhD openings are currently filled up but self-funded students are welcome to enquire and seek contact for discussions. 

### 2) There is currently a call for the [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Global Fellowships (GF): Hosting a European Postdoc at a university in ASEAN](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/briefing_on_msca_gf_2020_open.pdf?fbclid=IwAR363domrqO4RotLFlfWmNOYU4ks3ukRkvVJqld8kTu3E9Px_343XzBY10I). 

Here are some brief details about the fellowship: 

The MSCA Global Fellowships support the international career of researchers by giving them the opportunity to conduct a research project in a host institution located in a Third Country.  Third Countries are all those countries that do not belong to the European Union (so-called EU Member States) and that are not associated with the European Research Area (so-called Associated Countries). ALL countries in ASEAN are eligible under this scheme as Third Countries.  

The Fellow will spend between 12 and 24 months conducting postdoctoral research at the Third Country institution. This is followed by a mandatory return phase of 12 months to be spend at a host institution in an EU Member State or Associated Country.

During the whole duration of the Fellowship the researcher is employed by the European host institution and is seconded to the Third Country for the outgoing phase. The entire duration of the Fellowship is funded by the EU.

**<ins>Information in brief</ins>**  
**Timeline:** The Call for Application will open on **8 April 2020 with a deadline of 9 September 2020**.  
**Who is eligible:** The applicant must have a doctoral degree or at least 4 years of full-time research experience by the time of the call deadline. This action is open to applicants from a European Union Member State or an Associated Country.
GF are also open for nationals of third countries if they are long-term residents in Europe, i.e. a period of >= 5 consecutive years spent in an EU Member State or Associated Country prior to the deadline.  
**How long is the fellowship:** 12–24 months in Third Country (+1 year mandatory return phase in Europe).  
**What can be funded:** All research areas can be funded. MSCA Fellows come from a wide variety of disciplines, i.e. physics, linguistics, health-sciences, mathematical modelling, etc.  
**What the funding covers:** The grant provides an allowance to cover living, travel, and family costs. In addition, the EU contributes to the training, networking and research costs of the fellow, as well as to the management and indirect costs of the project. The grant is awarded to the host organisation, usually a university, research centre or a company in Europe.  
**Application and evaluation:** Applicants submit a research proposal, including their CV. **The proposal is written jointly with the applicant’s chosen host organisations.**

Interested applicants are encouraged to contact Dr Mark Ng at mark[dot]ng[at]ulster[dot]ac[dot]uk.

## Mechatronics Technician (Full Time) ##

The School of Engineering at the Ulster University, UK is hiring a Technician in Mechatronics Engineering. The position will provide technical support for teaching, research and other activities of the School. 

Deadline: 24th Nov 2019

## Funded PhD Opportunity ##

Title: Photoelectrocatalytic reactor with microcontroller-based control system for the elimination of antimicrobial resistant organisms in water

Summary: Globally, about 1.8 Billion people live without access to improved water sources. Alarmingly, Contaminants of Emerging Concerns (CECs) such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, metal based nanoparticles, and other pollutants, including pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARBs) were reported to be present in the treated sewage as well as in drinking water around the world. Photoelectrolytic (or electrochemically assisted photocatalytic) treatment of water is an interesting approach for the tertiary treatment of wastewater. This novel technology has been poorly investigated thus far for the simultaneous degradation or organic pollutants and removal of microorganisms present in wastewater. The objective of this PhD project relates to the development of an application of a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) for the removal of Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria (ARB) in water.

This PhD project will focus on the following main objectives:
 - Detection of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in water using microbial and molecular techniques.
 - Selection and characterisation of an UV sensor material for automatic control of a photoreactor.
 - Design of a microcontroller-based control program for the operation of a photoelectrochemical reactor based on UV dose sensing.
 - Construction and assessment of an photoelectrocatalytic reactor with UV-feedback microcontroller-based control system for the elimination of antimicrobial organisms in water.



Deadline: 7th February 2020
