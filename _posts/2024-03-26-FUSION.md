Mark Ng is part of the team in an InterTradeIreland Innovation Boost (formerly FUSION) knowledge transfer initiative with ARQ Reliability as the industrial partner. The project will develop AI-controlled sensors for monitoring lubricant oil conditions that will communicate data to a platform where the data can be visualised, thus optimising the oil management system for large-scale use by multiple industries for a range of applications.
