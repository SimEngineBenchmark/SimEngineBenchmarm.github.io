The Matlab/Simulink-based TCSI Simulation Testbed is now available for download. The simulation testbed is briefly described [here](https://nkymark.github.io/TCSI) and it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nkymark/TCSISimTestbed).

Full details on this research will be published in the April, 2020 issue of the *IEEE Control Systems*.



Cheers.
