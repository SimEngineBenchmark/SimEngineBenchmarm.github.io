Our paper on "A Sliding Mode Observer for Infinitely Unobservable Descriptor Systems" is now published in the *IEEE 
Transactions on Automatic Control*.

Abstract: In existing work of sliding mode observers (SMOs) for descriptor systems, a necessary condition is that the system 
must be infinitely observable. This paper presents a scheme that circumvents that condition, by reformulating the system as a 
reduced-order system where certain structures in the system matrix are manipulated and certain states are treated as unknown 
inputs. Following that, an SMO is implemented on the reduced-order system where state and fault estimation can be achieved. 
Necessary and sufficient conditions of this scheme are also presented. Finally, a simulation example shows the effectiveness of 
the proposed scheme.
