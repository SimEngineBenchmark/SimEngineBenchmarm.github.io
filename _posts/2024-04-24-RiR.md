Mark Ng has secured funding from the Innovation Launchpad Network+ (part of Innovate UK and EPSRC) for Tranche 3 of the Researcher in Residence (RiR) scheme, where he will work with the Catapult Network, especially the Digital Catapult as the primary collaborator alongside the Energy Systems and Offshore Renewable Energy Catapults. Together with the Catapults as well as other key industrial partners, this project will develop an energy mapping Digital Twin technology that contributes towards net zero in wind turbine energy. This technology encompasses the entire energy lifecycle, from mining through storage to utilisation in Northern Ireland.
