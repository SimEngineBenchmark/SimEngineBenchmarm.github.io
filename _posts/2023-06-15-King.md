Heartiest and deepest congratulations to our collaborator Dr Tudor Codreanu from the Western Australia Department of Health to receive the Public Service Medal for this yearâ€™s King Charles III's Birthday Honours List in Australia!

Very well deserved and it has been a privilege for my team to collaborate with Tudor on modelling COVID-19 outbreaks on commercial cargo vessels. Looking forward to many more collaborations in the future! 

For the curious few, the outcome of this research was published in the [WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs (Springer Nature)](https://t.co/mT1A8azUHd).
