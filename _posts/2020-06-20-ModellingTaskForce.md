Mark Ng and Pardis Biglarbeigi are part of the COVID-19 Modelling Task Force at Ulster University, where the Schools of Engineering and Computing are collaborating on a project to develop mathematical models that could better understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

The team are working closely with the Southern Health and Social Care Trust and a member from the Government's Specialist Modelling Response Expert Group in Northern Ireland.

The main purpose of the project is to validate and inform the Modelling Response Groupâ€™s work as well as help governing bodies in Northern Ireland to better plan for intervention measures and ultimately flatten the curve.

More details of this project can be found [here](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/coronavirus/research/innovation/modelling-the-transmission-dynamics-of-covid-19).
