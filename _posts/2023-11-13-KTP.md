Mark Ng is leading an exciting Knowledge Transfer Program (KTP) project with Elite Electronic Systems as the industrial partner. The KTP will focus on tackling the complex task of building a smart sensor and data analysis system for fault detection in a Surface Mount Technology (SMT) manufacturing process, leading to a Digital Twin to enhance yield reliability and quality. To realise the successful completion of this project, a KTP Associate will be engaged for 2 years to work on this project. This project hopes to directly contribute towards enhancing performance accuracy and shaping the future of digital manufacturing systems, especially in Northern Ireland.
