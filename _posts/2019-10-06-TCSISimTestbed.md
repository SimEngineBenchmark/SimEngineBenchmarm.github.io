The Matlab/Simulink-based TCSI Simulation Testbed designed is now available for download. The simulation testbed is briefly described [here](https://nkymark.github.io/downloads) and it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nkymark/TCSISimTestbed).


Cheers.

>> Functionality for data-driven test selection has been added to the toolbox. the implemented method is described in detail in the publication
"_Residual Selection for Consistency Based Diagnosis Using Machine Learning Models_" published at IFAC Safeprocess 2018 in Warszaw, Poland. Find the full paper at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.09.547](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.09.547).

>> See the [tutorial](/tutorial/rf-test-selection/) for an introduction to the functionality.
