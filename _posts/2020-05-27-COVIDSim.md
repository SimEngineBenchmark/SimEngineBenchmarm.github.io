We have designed and developed a Matlab/Simulink-based COVID-19 Simulation Package. The model used in the simulation package is a modified SEIRS model with consideration for ageing population, as well as time delay factors for control action and potential resusceptibility. The simulation package is briefly described [here](https://nkymark.github.io/COVIDSIM) and it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nkymark/COVIDSIM).

Full details on this research can be found in our paper in [*Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2020.132599).
