Our paper on "Predicting Maximum Permitted Process Forces for Object Grasping and Manipulation Using a Deep Learning Regression Model" has been accepted for presentation at the prestigious *8th IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (IEEE CCTA) 2024*, which will be held in August 2024 at Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. PhD researcher and first author of the paper, Stefanie Wucherer will be sharing the outcomes from this research with fellow experts in the field.

All the very best, Stefanie!
