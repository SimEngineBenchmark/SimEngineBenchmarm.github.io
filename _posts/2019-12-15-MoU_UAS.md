Today, we are delighted to announce that an MoU has been signed with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Augsburg University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Augsburg) in Germany for joint supervisions of Ph.D. researchers, hence opening up opportunities for research collaborations between the campuses on mechatronic engineering and robotics as well as autonomous systems. 

This initiative also enables researchers from both campuses to conduct research in the partner campus to enhance both technical knowledge and cultural exchanges.
