Mark Ng secured funding from the Erasmus+ Staff Mobility Program to spend 10 days as a Visiting Researcher at the Augsburg 
University of Applied Sciences in Germany. 

He visited the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Autonomous Vehicle Research Team to initiate research collaborations with 
the team, where he also delivered 2 key lectures on
* “A Turbocharged Petrol Engine System as a Simulation Benchmark Model for Fault Diagnosis”
* “Design and Development of A Fault Isolation Scheme on A Vehicular Engine System”

He also visited the Technologie Centrum Westbayern in Nördlingen to discuss on robotics engineering and Industry 4.0 matters 
with the researchers there.

He also had the opportunity to be invited as a special guest representing the School of Engineering in Ulster University at the 
graduation ceremony, where students from UU graduated with their Masters in Mechatronics Engineering from Augsburg via a 
long-standing jointly-offered exchange program between both campuses.
