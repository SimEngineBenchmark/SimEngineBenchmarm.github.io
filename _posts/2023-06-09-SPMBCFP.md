Mark Ng is the Technical Program Chair for the *2023 IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium*, now in its 14th year. 

The symposium is sponsored by the IEEE Region 2 Philadelphia Section, Temple University, and the Neural Engineering Data Consortium. This symposium is intended to bring together a wide range of professionals interested in applications of signal processing medicine and biology. Signal processing and artificial intelligence are rapidly transforming healthcare due to the significant success deep learning technology is enjoying recently. The enormous amounts of data that can be mined from devices, medical records and the Internet is enabling a new generation of technology based on big data.

The symposium typically consists of 18 highly-competitive full paper submissions that include oral presentations, and 12 to 18 single-page abstracts that are presented as posters. Two plenary lectures are included - one focused on research and the other focused on emerging technology.

The symposium covers traditional topics such as
* Signal and image analysis (e.g., EEG, ECG, MRI) 
* Machine learning, data mining and classification
* Big data resources and applications
* Applications of quantum computing

In addition, the symposium also has particular interest in the following this year:
* Digital Pathology
* Computational Biology
* Genomics, Genetics, Proteomics
