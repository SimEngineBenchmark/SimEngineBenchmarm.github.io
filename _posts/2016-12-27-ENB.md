Our paper "Development of a prototype smart home intelligent lighting control architecture using sensors onboard a mobile 
computing system" is now published in the *Energy and Buildings*.

Abstract: As smartphones become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, integrating them into intelligent lighting systems can 
boost both convenience and energy efficiency. This paper presents an intelligent lighting system prototype with enhanced 
security features for smart homes. The custom-built Android mobile application made use of the onboard ambient light sensor to 
run a novel closed-loop feedback algorithm to implement daylight harvesting. A cost analysis shows that the whole system setup 
is slightly cheaper than commercial products and due to its daylight harvesting capabilities, has potential for monetary 
savings in the long run, outperforming current commercial products.
