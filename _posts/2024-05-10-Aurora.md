As with many other countries all around the world, we here in Northern Ireland too enjoyed a good show of the aurora due to significantly higher than usual solar activity on the Sun, in particular solar flares directed towards the Earth. And it is extremely rare to be able to see them with the naked eyes at this latitude.
