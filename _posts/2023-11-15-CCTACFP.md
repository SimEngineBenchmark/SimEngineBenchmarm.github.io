Mark Ng is the Workshop Chair for the *2024 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications*, now in its 8th year. 

The CCTA conference is one of the main conferences sponsored by the IEEE Control Systems Society. The CCTA 2024 Technical Program will include regular and invited sessions, as well as application-oriented tutorial and workshop sessions, and of course a number of keynote and plenary lectures on some of the cutting-edge control technology topics.

The conference will be held at Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne in the city center campus.

Authors of selected articles presented at CCTA 2024 will be invited to prepare an extended version of their work to be considered for publication in a Special Issue of IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST). Authors of relevant papers published recently in TCST may apply to give oral presentations of their published work at CCTA. Deadline for paper submission is **5th February 2024**.

**Call for Contributed Papers**: Papers are invited in the form of regular manuscripts. Papers must conform to the submission policy, described below, requiring that all manuscripts be in 2-column format and meet strict page limits.

**Call for Invited Sessions**: Invited sessions consist of 5-6 papers, which should present a unifying theme from a diversity of viewpoints. Proposals must describe the motivation and relevance of the session. Proposals must be accompanied by full versions of each paper, which will be individually reviewed together with the proposal itself. Individual papers may be removed from a proposed session and replaced by appropriate contributed papers. In case an entire proposed session is rejected, selected papers may be accepted as contributed papers.

**Call for Tutorial Sessions**: Tutorial sessions and panel discussions addressing state-of-the-art control theory and advanced industrial applications are solicited.

**Call for Workshops**: Workshops to be held prior to the conference are solicited on all related topics. Proposals for workshops addressing novel control methodologies and control applications are strongly encouraged.

**Workshops and tutorials will take place on the 20th of August 2024.**
