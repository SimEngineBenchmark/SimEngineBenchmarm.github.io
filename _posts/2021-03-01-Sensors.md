Mark Ng is the Lead Guest Editor for the Special Issue on "Smart Homes: A Prospective of Sensing, Communication, and Automation" to be published in *Sensors* (MDPI).

Abstract: Despite being conceptualised during the 1980s, the term “Internet of Things” was not coined until 1999. Since then, we have seen exciting and continuous growth in research and development in the field, especially towards the applications of integration with smart sensors in smart homes and equivalent environments. The current situation that is the COVID-19 pandemic has further pushed for more aggressive and innovative research and development of IoT in smart homes for automation and healthcare, amongst others.

The purpose of this Special Issue is to report on the latest research findings on smart homes and the related developments. Papers that are focused on the development and integration of sensors in specific research areas such as (but not limited to) intelligent lighting systems, healthcare and diagnostics, wireless communications, home control and automation, monitoring, and mobile computing, as well as web services and cloud computing, are also welcome.
